Explanation:
---------------------------------
- The EMPA data are presented with the mass oxide percent alongside the relevant errors for each element. 
- The pXRF data are presented with their relevant intensity. No standards were run during data acquisition of pXRF data, so the intensities are not synonymous with absolute mass percents. Instead, only relative abundances among samples should be considered.
