# MS_thesis_Smith_2025
Data files associated with the MS thesis of Alexander Smith, Mizzou, 2025.

Explanation of Files:
-----------------------------------------------------------------

**Geochemistry of the Black Mtn. Gravity Slide** -> files contain all of the major and minor oxide geochemistry in weight percent. Analyses performed using XRF. Trace elements are reported in ppm, and they were analyzed using LA-ICP-MS.
- [Major Element Geochemistry](major_elements.csv)
- [Minor and Trace Geochemistry](trace_elements.csv)

**Zircon U/Pb Geochronology** -> Files contain the results of LA-ICP-MS spot analyses on Zircons. The data are abundances of U and Pb and Th isotopes, their ratios, and the best age calculated from these isotopes. The `csv` also contains information such as concordance and rejected analyses which may be found at the bottom of the table. For future usage of these data, it is recommended to separate the rejected analyses before manipulating the dataset. 
- [Geochronology](/geochron)
- The 'Type' column indicates either detrital or igneous zircons
- On import to excel, 7/35 or 6/38 column ID may auto-format to a date. 

**Pseudotachylyte Geochemistry** -> Files contain the results of various geochemical methods (written in the file name) performed on the glass or plagioclase portion of pseudotachylyte specimens from this research. 
- [PST Geochemistry](/pst)
- [Photos of PST Post-ablation](/pst/relected_light_photos)
